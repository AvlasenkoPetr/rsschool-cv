## **About me**

Sup, my name is Petya, im 21 years old and im from Belarus. I was born in Minsk, studied at 50th gymnasium after graduating from which i entered BSUIR. Unfortunately i picked wrong specialization, which was all about engineering so i left university after 3 years and started to study by my own. I really like front-end direction, so i'm sure that my effort will be enough to end this course. 

(at least i hope so)

## **My skills**

In university i had an opportunity to work with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python (ngl i was terrible at this)
* Assembler
* MySQL
* Cisco PocketTracer

But i believe that most important skill i got in university is knowledge how to learn quickly, work under stress and find answers by my own

And my english is between B1 and B2 levels

(at least StreamLine online tests say so)
