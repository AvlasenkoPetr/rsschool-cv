## **About me**

Sup, my name is Petya, im 21 years old and im from Belarus. I was born in Minsk, studied at 50th gymnasium after graduating from which i entered BSUIR. Unfortunately i picked wrong specialization, which was all about engineering so i left university after 3 years and started to study by my own. I really like front-end direction, so i'm sure that my effort will be enough to end this course and get a job. 

(at least i hope so)

## **My skills**

In university i had an opportunity to work with:
1. HTML
1. CSS
2. JavaScript
3. Python (ngl i was terrible at this)
4. Assembler
2. MySQL
3. Cisco PocketTracer
3. And even C++

But i believe that the most important skill i got in university is knowledge how to learn quickly, work under stress and find answers by my own.


## **Code examples**

Haven't got any examples yet :P 

Maybe i'll find smth of my university tasks and upload, but im not sure i still have anything of it.

## **Job experience**

Also don't have any...

## **Education**

I studied at 50th gymnasium after graduating from which i entered BSUIR. Unfortunately i picked wrong specialization, which was all about engineering so i left university after 3 years and started to study by my own.

## **English level**

I've been learning it since i was 6 but in last few years my practice was limited to watching american late shows on youtube.

My knowledge of english is now between B1 and B2 levels.

(at least StreamLine online tests say so)
